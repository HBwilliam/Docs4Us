**Goal:**  
FernDB aims to build a fully functional database from the ground up, providing a robust solution for data storage and retrieval. The project focuses on creating a comprehensive architecture that encompasses all essential components of a modern database system.

### Key Components to Develop:

1. **Storage Engine:**
    
    - **Data Structure:** Design a suitable data structure for efficient storage and retrieval (e.g., B-trees, hash tables).
    - **Data Serialization:** Implement methods for serializing and deserializing data for persistent storage.
    - **Indexing:** Create indexing mechanisms to speed up query performance.
    - **Concurrency Control:** Ensure safe access for multiple users with mechanisms like locking or multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    
    - **User Commands:** Develop a CLI for users to interact with FernDB, allowing them to execute queries, manage tables, and perform administrative tasks.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error reporting and feedback mechanisms for user commands.
3. **API:**
    
    - **RESTful API:** Design a RESTful API to allow external applications to interact with the database, supporting operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    - **Authentication:** Implement security measures to authenticate API requests and protect user data.
4. **Web Admin Panel (Optional):**
    
    - **Dashboard:** Create a web-based interface to visualize database performance, monitor usage, and manage database entities.
    - **Data Management:** Provide tools for users to easily add, modify, and delete records.
    - **Analytics:** Implement analytics features to give insights into data trends and system performance.
5. **Query Language:**
    
    - **Custom Query Language:** Develop a custom query language (or SQL-like syntax) for users to interact with the database efficiently.
    - **Parser:** Build a parser to interpret user queries and convert them into executable commands.
6. **Backup and Recovery:**
    
    - **Backup Mechanisms:** Implement functionalities to create backups of the database to prevent data loss.
    - **Recovery Procedures:** Develop recovery mechanisms to restore the database to a consistent state after a failure.
7. **Documentation:**
    
    - **User Manual:** Provide comprehensive documentation for users, detailing installation, usage, and troubleshooting.
    - **API Documentation:** Create clear API documentation to assist developers in integrating with FernDB.

### Future Enhancements (Optional):

- **Replication:** Introduce data replication for high availability and load balancing.
- **Sharding:** Implement sharding to distribute data across multiple servers for scalability.
- **Caching Layer:** Develop a caching layer to improve query performance for frequently accessed data.
