## Context:
___

In our daily lives, we interact with databases in countless waysâ€”whether it's using social media, shopping online, or managing personal information. Databases are the backbone of these applications, storing and organizing vast amounts of data efficiently. However, most of us use these systems without fully grasping their inner workings.

This is why we are taking on the challenge of building **FernDB** from the ground up. By coding our own database, we aim to gain a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and intricacies that underlie data storage, retrieval, and management. This hands-on experience will not only enhance our technical skills but also provide valuable insights into optimizing performance, ensuring data integrity, and designing scalable systems. Ultimately, creating **FernDB** will empower us to appreciate the complexities of databases and become more proficient in leveraging them in our future projects.

## Conventions:
___

naming conventions => CamelCase

## Choices to make:
___

languages: python vs rust vs half/half

python => data analysis directly embedded in the database
rust => powerful, safe, efficient
half/half => py03

python => parser, api, query, tools, etc
rust => storage engine (storage and retrieval)
